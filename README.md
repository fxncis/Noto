# Noto
Noto is an open sourced application dedicated to help people remove friends on ROBLOX. Noto only uses only framework which is Electron and we rely on TypeScript to make sure our application doesn't encounter errors during development.

Noto was created was to help people suffer the long wait of unfriending accounts.
Noto has failed many times along the way, We've tried making it a discord bot, a website, and finally, we are trying to make Noto
an application that helps users remove friends. It was also created to get me known.. hehe
